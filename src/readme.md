### 🛠 update notes
+ DONE : integrated bullet physics

### 🗺 future work
+ improve lighting system
  + add shadows
  + add dynamic lights
+ destructibles
  + props
  + buildings
+ physics
  + mesh / convex colliders
  + refactor physics
  + how should collider meshes be colored?

### 🐞 bugs & issues
- lighting shader(s) need revision

### 🎮 main.cpp
- init window, input, game systems, and timer
- main game loop
  - update window & input
  - handle key input
  - update game state
  - update renderer
  - render scene
  - update frame timer & restart loop
- shutdown window & exit

### 😡 enemies.h
green spheres that turn more red as they take damage and explode when destroyed

### 🔫 weps.h

#### bullets
bullets have a type, damage, and age(for despawning)
#### weapon types
Gun_Meta: struct containing information for all weapon types like mag count, fire rate, audio, etc.
#### weapon animation
every weapon has it's own animation function that handles all the visual aspects of the animation
such as keyframe selection and blending based on the state of the weapon

in general, weapon animations are grouped by wep type (smg, rifle, bolt action, etc),but depending
on the wep there may be custom animations

### 🧙 player.h
player is just a camera glued to a physics sphere

### 🛢 props.h
handles static prop behavior & rendering

- crates : wooden, break into planks
- tanktraps : metal barrier
- sandbag : sand barrier
- campfire : emits light, breaks into stones & sticks, interactable place to cook fish
- tree : cover, can be chopped down
- barrel : explosive

### 💥 particles.h
a particle is defined as...

### ⛰ terrain.h

- HEIGHTMAP_N : terrain resolution; how many data points define the terrain(no effect on in game size)
- HEIGHTMAP_L : length of a side of the (square) terrain in game in meters
- HEIGHTMAP_S : vertical scale of the terrain; y position highest point (terrain data file is normalized 0-1)

defines the structure that stores all the heightmap data for the game map as well as some functions
for manipulating it like explode()

also loads heightmaps from .R32 files

### 🧲 physics.h
- colliders : cube, cone, sphere, capsule, cylinder, heightmap

### 🎨 renderer.h
+ TODO : try to at least document the animation stuff

### ⚙️ window.h
Handles opening a window, setting up OpenGL & OpenAL, and handling keyboard/mouse input

### ⚙️ boilerplate.h
contains all external libraries & includes + mathematics.h, contains macros for printing to
console & allocating memory; contains code for file reading, timers, multithreading, and playing audio

#### preprocessor directives
- out : currently a wrapper for cout
- stop : pauses the program
- print : printf without the f
- printvec : print any vector with xyz components
- Alloc : allocate memory (release with free() from std library)

#### file handling
- read_text_file_into_memory : reads an entire text file into a buffer
- load_file_r32 : reads a .r32 file and rotates the array so it is oriented correctly `(why does this happen?)`

#### timers
- get_timestamp : generate a timestamp at the current time
- calculate_elapsed : calculate the time elapsed between 2 timestamps
- os_sleep : put the thread to sleep for x milliseconds

#### audio
- load_audio : loads audio from a .audio file
- play_audio : plays audio

#### external libraries
- Bullet : 3d physics, modified by me to not need libraries; i.e. you just need to #include it
- GLFW : for opening a window, handling input
- GLEW : OpenGL extension wrangler, don't remember what it does but it does do something
- GLM : math, i hope to replace with something proprietary and smaller at some point
- OpenAL : for audio
- stb_image : for loading images from disk
- stb_image_write : for writing images to disk

### 🧰 extras

#### what file types does the game use?
- meshes : `.mesh`, `.mesh_uv`, `.mesh_anim`, `.mesh_anim_uv`
- animation : `.anim`
- audio : `.audio`
- textures : `.bmp`, `.png(bit depth = 32)`
- heightmap : `.r32`

#### how to i generate these files?
- `png`, `bmp` : whatever you like, just make sure they are formatted correctly
- `r32` : generated with krita (1024 x 1024)
- `mesh`,`anim`, and `audio`: generated by [game-file-converter](https://github.com/Moomed-Hamed/game-file-converter)
